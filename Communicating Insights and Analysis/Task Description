Task Description: Recording my thought process and conclusion on the complete project and findings

The task required the creation of a video presentation summarizing the data analysis findings for the CEO and CMO. 
Based on the four questions posed in the previous tasks and the accompanying visuals, I recorded a video to effectively convey insights.
The presentation encompassed the entire data analysis process, from the initial data load and cleanup to the final conclusions. 
I focused on the most relevant information to the CEO and CMO, ensuring that the video was concise and informative.
The video was approximately 5 minutes in length uploaded from a personal device. 
The presentation went beyond a simple readout of the visuals, providing context for each scenario and its relationship to the CEO and CMO's inquiries.
While the video was not required by the CEO/CMO, it served as a valuable resource for me to learn to organize my thoughts and ensure a coherent and engaging presentation.
