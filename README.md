Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

### Project Overview
An online retail store hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business as Management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue performance so they can strategically plan for next year. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. I need to draft the relevant analytics, visuals and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decisions that will generate revenue and business growth in the future.

### Project Tasks
* **Task 1:** I was tasked with drafting questions that I think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. I was given company sales data to be used as the basis of my exploration and analysis.
* **Task 2:** In this task I had to determine which types of visuals would be best to answer 5 questions which give understanding to the business requirements from the perspective of the CEO and CMO. Each question represents a scenario which I needed a visual to go along with said scenario.
* **Task 3:** This task involved analyzing the online store's performance data to provide visual insights for an expansion strategy that would be undertaken by the CEO and CMO. Key areas of focus include revenue trends, category performance, and identifying factors affecting sales. Visualisations were created using Power BI to effectively communicate findings. 
* **Task 4:** This task required me to present my data analysis findings to the CEO and CMO. I focused on my thought process, data cleanup, visualization, and the analysis of the four questions answered in Task 3. I aimed to clearly explain my ideas, thought process, and conclusions to help the leaders understand potential growth opportunities. I delivered this presentation in the form of a video.
