Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights

### Project Overview
An online retail store hired me as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business as Management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue performance so they can strategically plan for next year. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. I need to draft the relevant analytics, visuals and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decisions that will generate revenue and business growth in the future.
